This is an assignment in which we are tasked with implementing various Bootstrap elements into our portfolios, as well as creating a responsive layout using grids (rows & columns). This was done with no media queries in the stylesheets.

Using Bootstrap, recreate portfolio site with the following items:
 -A navbar
 -A responsive layout using the grid, rows and columns.
